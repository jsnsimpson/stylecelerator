stylecelerator
==============

Stylecelerator is a tool used for titanium projects to assist the developer in updating the layout components of their app without the need for recompiling (time consuming and annoying).
This plugin will allow the user to manipulate the UI properties of on screen elements with a simple interface after it has compiled allowing the developer to tweak pixels here and there for maximum productivity when laying out the UI.
